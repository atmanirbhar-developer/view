## Environment

I have "Prettier" as a VS Code plug-in, configured to run when a file is saved -- please do the same:

- In VS Code, install the "Prettier" VS Code plug-in
- Go to "File > Preferences > Settings" and change the "Prettier Print Width" value to `120` (the default value is `80`).

Or install Prettier on the command-line and run it before a commit:

    prettier --write --print-width 120 .
