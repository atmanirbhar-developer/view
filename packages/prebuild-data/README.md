The code in this package pre-builds sample data (e.g. users and discussions) which is used to populate the server.

Its output is to the [`/server_data`](../server_data) package.

It can process any non-standard, site-specific sample data if you write that data to the `./data/*.alt` directories
(which may be useful if you want to use this for more than one site).
